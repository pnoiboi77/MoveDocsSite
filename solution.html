<!--THESE SHOULD BE ADVERTISING <p class="plans">Don't Lose Files - A stolen laptop or lost cell phone doesn't have to mean lost files. When your files are stored on movedocs, you'll never lose important financial information or the latest draft of your resume.</p>

								<p class="plans"> Sleep Well - MoveDocs secured data center, facilities and operations are Safe Harbor certified. MoveDocs also encrypts your data at transfer with high-grade SSL and at rest with 256-bit AES.</p> 


							Forget email attachment limits and the confusion of email threads. With MoveBox, you can send large files with a simple link. You can even share entire folders.

						* No Software Needed - When you share a link with someone, they can click on the link and immediately view it in their browser - without needing to sign in, download or open other software.
					

					* Control Document Access - You can also restrict a viewers' ability to share or download your files of your choice.
					

					Your Files Are Safe

Once your files are on MoveDocs, they're not safe and secure. You get the same level of security as our business customers.-->
